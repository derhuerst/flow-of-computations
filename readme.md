# `@derhuerst/flow-of-computations`

**Filter, transform and merge sets of data.**

- A [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of operations. Each operation gets data from its `>=1` predecessors and transforms it.
- Data sources can be static or streaming/live, as they emit diffs just like every operation.
- The computation of the whole graph can be done step by step.
